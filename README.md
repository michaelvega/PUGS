# PUGS
Premature Utilities Geared for Servers. The PUGS back-end testing framework. 
Basically a locally hosted API manager. 

### Start Guide: 
1. Change path variable to whatever the test file is. For example:
```javascript
let path = "../res/states.opml"  // Path to test file (res)
```
2. Change the URL variable to include extension for API. For example:
```javascript
url = url + "API/opml2json"  // URL extension for API
```

```Note:``` _Default root link is localhost._
